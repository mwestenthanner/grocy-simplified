# Grocy Simplified
## A simplified and streamlined frontend for the grocery ERP

[Grocy](https://grocy.info) is a great tool for household management - but for a lot of users (including me), it just offers way too many features. With Grocy Simplified, I am building an alternate frontend that omits a lot of the original features to focus on simple pantry and recipe management. The design is heavily inspired by the beautiful and user-friendly [Grocy android app](https://github.com/patzly/grocy-android) so both can be used together as seamlessly as possible.

To use Grocy Simplified, a running Grocy installation is necessary. This is not a standalone application, but merely a frontend that connects to your Grocy instance via the API.

## Planned Features

### Grocery management
- Manage products in pantry without having to track exact numbers
- Status-based product management
- Automatically add products to shopping list based on status 

### Recipe management
- Simpler recipe writing and reading
- Tag and group recipes
